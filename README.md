# Day 3 - GitHub Exercise
Welcome to the final exercise of Day 3. 

## Part 1) - Getting the Code
  -  Create a Fork of the Code (This will create a version of the code in its current state on your GitHub Account)
  -  Create a Local Repository and connect it to your forked remote repository
  -  Make a pull request to Pull the Code from the remote repository to your local repository
## Part 2) - Changing the Code
Calculator.py currently takes two numbers and adds them together, the code is very basic. We would like to create functional code that adds more features.
The file should have the following methods:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Ratio - Returns either as a decimal or percentage based on parameter. Also should use Addition function as part of ratio function

## Part 3) Branches and Uploading
Updating the Code in Calculator.py should not be done on the main branch. You should create a seperate branch feature-calculator. Once you're happy upload feature-calculator to GitHub. This way someone else (theoretically) can give you the go ahead to say your code is working. Once happy, commit the changes to the main branch. Don't delete the feature-calculator branch, because you could come back to update this code again later on with more functionality, and thus need this branch again.

Once you've created done that, create another branch feature-ratio_calc that modifies the calculate ratio.py to take two user numbers as input, and importing your ratio function from your Calculator module, returns the ratio and and prints the result.


## Part 4) Upload your own code to GitHub
You might want to upload the game you've made, or your Jackpot Simulator Solution to GitHub! That way employers or other like minded programmers can see you work!



You can make up your own exercises, or play with existing examples like the Goblins vs. Humans, and upload it to GitHub
